			<h1>12 Health Benefits of Practicing Pilates</h1>
			<p>Studies have shown that Pilates improves quality of life by having a positive effect on depression and pain, most notably decreasing back pain.
				<br>

			It’s commonly used as cross-training workout and recommended by doctors for overall health, injury prevention, and rehabilitative purposes.
			</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Increased Flexibility</li>
			<p>A lot of movements in Pilates have a stretching component—take side kicks, for example, which stretch your entire backside, especially your calves, hamstrings, and glutes—so it makes sense that regularly practicing Pilates could boost your overall flexibility.</p>
				<li>Better Balance</li>
				<li>Improved Core Engagement</li>
			<p>By better engaging your core, you’ll be able to more effectively strengthen it and thus reap the benefits of a strong core—like better balance, stability, and overall functioning, as well as a reduced risk of low back pain.</p>
				<li> Body Awareness</li>
			<p>In Pilates, you don’t just move your body willy-nilly; instead, the goal is to perform each movement with your full attention. This mindfulness aspect of Pilates can give you a better sense of how you are moving your body in class.</p>
				<li> Low-Impact Exercise</li>
			<p>Pilates is a low-impact form of exercise that is gentle on your bones and joints. That means it can be a great fitness option for people who can’t do high-impact activities, like running or jumping.</p>
				<li>Better Coordination</li>
			<p>Pilates can build total-body coordination. That’s because it incorporates a lot of exercises that require multiple body parts to work in tandem.</p>
				<li>Breath Awareness</li>
			<p>Pilates emphasizes a type of deep breathing called “lateral costal breathing,” which involves expanding your ribs while contracting your abs, and each exercise in Pilates has a breath pattern attached to it.</p>
				<li> <em>Total-body Strengthening</em></li>
			<p>Pilates isn’t just about your core; it can also strengthen your entire body, says Green. That includes bigger muscle groups, like your glutes, quads, hamstrings, back, and chest, as well as smaller stabilizing muscles, including those that support your shoulders and spine.</p>
				<li><em> Enhanced Athletic Performance</em></li>
			<p>Pilates helps boost flexibility, mobility, and strength—three skills that improve the efficiency of your movements in general.</p>
				<li><em>Improved Control and Precision</em></li>
			<p>In Pilates, you may struggle to do certain moves at first. But with time and dedication, you can learn to move your body in new ways, which can make you feel invincible, powerful.</p>
				<li><em>Sense of Empowerment</em></li>
				<li><em>Mood Boosting</em></li>
			<p>Of course, no kind of exercise is going to replace treatment for conditions like anxiety or depression, but Pilates can be an awesome stress buster and mood booster. That’s because exercise can stimulate the production of endorphins in your brain, causing a general feeling of euphoria or well-being.</p>
